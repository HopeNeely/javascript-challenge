# JavaScipt Challenge 
This challenge entails using JavaScript, D3.js, HTML and CSS to organize data into a table that allows the end user to filter for specific values. The dataset given are accounts of ufo sightings. 

## Level 1 - Automatic Table and Date Search

1. I created a basic HTML web page.

2. Using a UFO dataset, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

3. Finally, I used a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

In the furture, I would like to take UFO sighting data to the next level! I plan to add a form to the HTML document for users to input their own UFO sightings. Each new sighting would append to the data file and become searchable in the table.
